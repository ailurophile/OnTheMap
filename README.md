The OnTheMap App was developed as part of the Udacity iOSDeveloper nanodegree program.  It authenticates users by having them log in to their Udacity accounts then takes them to a tab view which shows user pin locations on a map as well as in a list.  Each user can provide a unique link along with their location to be added to the map.  Tapping on a user's pin on the map or their entry in the table will bring up a detail view containing the link they provided and tapping the link will open the link in Safari.
