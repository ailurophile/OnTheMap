The OnTheMap App was developed as part of the Udacity iOSDeveloper nanodegree program.  It authenticates users by having them log in to their Udacity accounts then takes them to a tab view which shows user pin locations on a map as well as in a list.  If the user has no Udacity account, a link on the login screen will take them to the Udacity site where they can create one.  Each user can provide a unique link along with their location (entered as a text string & geocoded by the app) to be added to the map.  Tapping on a user's pin on the map or their entry in the table will bring up a detail view containing the link they provided and tapping the link will open the link in Safari.  If the user tries to add a pin but already has one in the system, they will be asked whether to overwrite it or to cancel.
